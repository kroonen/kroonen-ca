# Robin Kroonen's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my personal website! This site serves as a hub for my experiments, projects, and thoughts in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and various other interests.

## About Me

I'm Robin Kroonen, a passionate System Engineer with a keen interest in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. This website is where I share my journey, projects, and insights into the world of technology and beyond.

## Website Features

- **Game of Life Simulation**: An interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life, showcasing my interest in cellular automata and complex systems.
- **Project Showcase**: A collection of my work in CS and AI, demonstrating practical applications and experimental concepts.
- **Blog**: My thoughts, experiences, and learnings in tech and other areas of interest.
- **About Me**: More information about my background, skills, and aspirations.

## Technical Details

This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on modular and maintainable code. Key components include:

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
- `styles/main.css`: Contains all the CSS styles for a cohesive look and feel.
- `scripts/`:
  - `gameOfLife.js`: Implements the Game of Life simulation.
  - `ui.js`: Manages user interface interactions.
  - `main.js`: Initializes and connects all components.

## Local Development

To run this website locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run a local server. For example, with Python:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server`
   - Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Deployment

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. Any changes pushed to the main branch will automatically update the live site.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Add more interactive experiments in CS and AI.
- [ ] Expand the blog with regular posts on tech trends and personal insights. (Open-WebUI)
- [x] Implement a project portfolio section.
